		<p>To work on board a luxury yacht and be part of a unique lifestyle, you must remember standards and expectations are high. You have to be good - very good - but you also have to fit in, be a team-player, usually working long hours and living in tight quarters with shared crew cabins. Being employed by some of the World’s most affluent personalities, requires utmost discretion.</p>
		<p>Backed by references proving that they can deliver consistent and exceptional service, the successful candidate, should have the passion, flexibility and the right attitude to fulfill his/her ambitions.</p>
		<p>Are you determined to join, do you want to pursue a career in yachting?</p>
