		<!--<p>A large yacht is operated either as a private or commercial (charter) vessel. An increasing number of yachts are exceeding 3000 GT, which require full commercial merchant certification for all deck and engineering officers. Most yachts are ISM/ISPS MLC2006 compliant through classification and flag state.</p>
		<p>Years of experience and qualifications related to a certain position is of course essential, but there are a few tips to add to your CV: Dive certificate, first aid/medical course, hospitality service, languages, mechanic/carpentry, water sports experience, computer skills, driving license, boat handling, nursing etc In fact, any extra skill/hobby, you might see as a potential advantage to have on board. Longevity in previous held positions is a must for obvious reasons, as are great references and positive feed-back.</p>
		<p>Before being considered, all crewmembers should as a minimum hold; a STCW95 and ENG1 certificates. Additional courses, such as crowd management, fast rescue boat, advanced firefighting, helicopter ops. Security awareness, will depend on and correspond with your safety responsibilities on board the yacht’s emergency muster plan. </p>
		<p>STCW95: As a requirement to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW95) Basic Safety Training (BST); basic firefighting, personal sea survival, first aid and social responsibility. Usually, a 5 days course, but make sure the training facility is IMO recognized. The course is available in maritime centers around the world or in your home country. In the UAE contact EIMA Dubai Maritime city or ESTDC in Abu Dhabi. </p>
		<p>ENG1: Medical fitness certificate for seafarers, conducted by appointed doctors approved by the governing maritime administration.</p>
		<p>If you are a new talent, with no previous maritime experience, we encourage you to assist on smaller boats with day work, if for nothing else than to display determination on your CV and give you an initial edge. This is also a useful way to gain experience and assure yourself of a career in yachting. Mandatory safety training, added a relevant course, day-work or dock-walking, can eventually lead to a junior position. Positive and enthusiastic personality; can-do attitude, flexibility, willingness to learn, team-player, should all be integrated adjectives of your profile.</p>
