			<h2><span>About us</span></h2>
			<p>16 years of age, I began my career at sea. I had never thought of becoming a sailor, before attending an introduction meeting held at my local school, hosted by a Maersk Captain. After completing the basic maritime/safety course, I started out as Ordinary Seaman/Deck Hand on various coasters and container vessels. At first I quit, I thought I was too young, but eventually, I began to get my bearings right. On board EAC lines M/V Fionia, I was on the 8-12 watch with the Second Officer, who encouraged me to consider a future as deck officer, “you need to go ashore and study at the maritime academy”, he advised. A good call at the time, the future was looking bleak for Danish ratings and I still wanted to sail. </p>
			<p>I graduated the Master’s Examination from Svendborg International Maritime Academy (SIMAC) in 1993. I had to study hard, but it was a privilege and truly, the best investment I have ever made.</p>
			<p>Several of years passed as Deck Officer in the Danish merchant fleet, with Orion, DSB and Elite Shipping, including a new build container feeder and not to forget; an exotic gap year, studying Spanish at the South American Spanish Institute in Quito Ecuador, where I also had the luck of finding work as bartender in the notorious Papillon Bar. Anyway, I finally decided to pursue my dream to work on board a cruise ship and despite the sceptics, breaking away from a traditional career under Danish flag.</p>
			<p>With great enthusiasm, I joined the cruise industry in 1997 and served as Second/First Officer on board Cunard Line’s M/V Vistafjord and SeaGoddess 1. Cruising became a sort of a lifestyle, I guess it sounds more glamourous than it is. Like anything else, if you want to succeed; you need to be dedicated and work hard. As young adventurer, cruising and travelling the world, I enjoyed every moment of it and learned a lot. Later on, I was promoted to Safety/Chief Officer on board M/V Seabourn Sun, Seabourn Spirit and accepted the offer to join the RMS Queen Mary 2 project during the new build phase in France. With some 1300 crewmembers, the QM2 was in 2004, the largest Ocean Liner in the world. The christening ceremony and maiden voyage, are proud and unforgettable memories.</p>
			<p>Looking for a new challenge in the yachting industry, I moved to the UAE in 2005 to join Platinum Yachts 162 Meter new build project; M/Y Dubai, commissioned for the Royal family. The largest mega yacht in the world became a great highlight, both in my career and personal life. After a couple of years, I accepted to Captain Platinum’s conversion/refit project M/Y Dubawi and subsequently I was promoted back on board M/Y Dubai, where I have spent the last 5 years as Master and Fleet Captain at Platinum Yacht Management. Building a strong team on board, I often think of all the crewmembers, whose life were changed under the given circumstances. We gave it our best in forming the soul of M/Y Dubai. I have been grateful to serve the Royal family and playing my part in the yacht’s history and achievements</p>
			<p>Of course, back then (at 16 years), I could never have imagined such opportunities…………………………..</p>
